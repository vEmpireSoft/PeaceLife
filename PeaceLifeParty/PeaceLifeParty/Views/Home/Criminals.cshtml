                When a person is arrested he is in the hands of the Government.<br />

                They have been detained to be reformed and be reintroduced into the society.<br />

                They must not come out of the Government’s hands Crippled in Mind and Body.<br />

                We will study many Countries and learn how to help them from committing crime again.<br />

                They will be trained in mind and body to be able to reintroduce into the society. They will be properly employed as well.<br />

                Secondly, Prisons are Five Star Hotels.<br />
                Their environment will not be suitable for anybody to think about committing crimes.<br />

                We can even think about committing repeat offenders to places like Manus Island.<br />
