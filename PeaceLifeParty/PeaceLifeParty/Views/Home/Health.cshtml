                We will study health costs.<br />

                Health care costs are very high and hence unless the medical professionals take voluntary action to reduce costs, action will be taken to increase medical supplies from overseas.<br />

                Health care is not for greed.<br />

                <span style="color:red"> There will be no waiting list.</span><br />

                Medicine will be deregulated to cater for low cost medicines.  Quality will be strictly enforced.<br />
