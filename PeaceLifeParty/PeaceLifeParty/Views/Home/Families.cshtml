                All mothers with children can re-marry after checking their future partners with police check for criminals and paedophiles.<br />

                We will look at divorces to see whether the children may be left with the partner who does not wish to divorce except where violence and criminal activities are involved. This way daughters may be left with the fathers and sons with the mothers.
