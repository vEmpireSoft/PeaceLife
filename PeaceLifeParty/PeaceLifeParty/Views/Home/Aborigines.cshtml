                Come on. We have taken a whole Continent by two Magic words <b> TERRA NULLIUS </b>.<br />

                Forgetting the Past, we can do two things to right towards the owners of this great Continent.
            </p>
            <ol> <li>Make two permanent Ministries for Aborigines – one for Immigration and the other for Land and Resources Management. After all this is their land.</li>
                <li>Allocate prime lands in all States and call them Homeland for them so that those who wish to live there may go and develop their Culture.</li>
                <li>Less cost to businesses through loss and insurance costs, theft.</li>
                <li>The current generation can stop genocide.</li>
