                Ancient theory of <span style="color:red"> 5% Unemployment as full employment</span> is not acceptable considering that humans are not Resources for Business.<br />

                This was done in the ancient times to limit wage rises by controlling supply. However, currently the Wages of labour for public sector is controlled by All Levels of Government and the Private Sector follows this.<br />

                Hence the theory of keeping 5% unemployment falls under Human Right Violations.<br />

                Unions please note.<br />

                <span style="color:red">

                    If the economy goes down government will absorb any redundancies so that when economy starts booming a workforce is disciplined and ready to fill the need of the private sector.
