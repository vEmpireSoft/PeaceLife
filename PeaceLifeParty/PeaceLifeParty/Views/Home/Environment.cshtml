                Irrespective of diverse opinions we realise that we are polluting our environment. We will contribute our part.<br />

                We will develop a superior public transport for moving people to where they want without burning fuel.<br />

                Plant enough trees to offset carbon as well as to support our wood industry.<br />

                Support and develop and use alternate energy sources.<br />

                Environment will be protected as required by the International Body.<br />
