                Irrespective of diverse opinions we realise that we are polluting our environment. We will contribute our part.

                We will develop a superior public transport for moving people to where they want without burning fuel.

                Plant enough trees to offset carbon as well as to support our wood industry.

                Support and develop and use alternate energy sources.

                Environment will be protected as required by the International Body.
