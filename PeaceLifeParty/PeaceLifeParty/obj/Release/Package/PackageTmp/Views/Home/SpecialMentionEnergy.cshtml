                Let us do the maths.
                Oil:
                Consumption		960,800 bbl/day
                Production		549,200 bbl/day
                Exports		312,600 bbl/day
                Import			731,400 bbl/day
                Net Import/export    	731,400 – 312,600 = 418,800 bbl/day Imported
                <br />
                Cost of local production may be AU$5 but let us be generous and say $10/bbl
                For example, Cost of import is $100/bbl
                <br />
                Average Cost you should pay for petrol will be based on the above rates is = (549200*10  + 418800*100)/( 549200  + 418800) = $48.93/bbl
                <br />
                But we pay at the international rate of more than $100
                <br />
                We will look at this calculation and change the costing so that the people and all the Industries and Businesses will get this reduced cost with as per earlier proposed supply of Resources at local prices, will help them compete in the International Markets.
                <br />
                This reduced fuel charges apply only to Australians.  All internationals will pay at international price.
