                Banks will give loan to any depending on their income and liabilities.

                But we let a person have an open account to gamble his income, families and permit them to even commit crimes.

                Hence all will have ids to limit how much they can gamble.  Gambling venues will have access to a common database (subscribed by their venues) to restrict the limits of each gambler.

                All adults will be issued photo id cum Credit Card so that they can be allowed only 10% percentage of their income on gambling.

                Gambling is unproductive expenditure which does not produce any economic value except misery and heart ache destroying families and leading to criminal activities.

                All night clubs will have sniff dogs to check for drugs.

                Compulsory treatment for drug addicts.
                Human rights will be established and maintained.
